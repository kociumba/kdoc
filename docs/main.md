# main.go

this is the main implementation for kdoc

it is a "dumb" code documentation generator, this means that kdoc unlike generators
such as doxygen or godoc does not actually understand the code it generates the docs for

this allows it to be very simple, quite fast and mostly language agnostic

the main use case is meant for c/c++ but any language with comments will work with it
